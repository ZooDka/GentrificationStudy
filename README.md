Census Analysis Project using R and Python

I picked the topic of analyzing how socioeconomic inequality evolves around states and cities in the US, using census data. I am interested in learning about the urban sociology of cities/states, how different social groups (class, race) live in cities, gentrification I aim to answer the questions like:

how have inequality and segregation evolved between 2011 to 2023?

how median income/rent has changed in areas across time?

is there a rise in college educated residents?

do poverty rates, race or education affect the median income in that neighborhood?

what factors could influence a neighborhood/state to perform well or not?
